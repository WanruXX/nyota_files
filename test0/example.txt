Rainbow Harvest

Garnet beads are round and full, with a deep, alluring wine-red hue, reminiscent of ripe pomegranate seeds. Tourmaline crystals are transparent and vibrant, like a dreamy neon, reflecting brilliant light under illumination.

The combination of these two creates a striking yet harmonious clash of colors, with red and multicolored hues intertwining like a grand jewelry feast, exuding elegance with every movement. Garnet can improve blood circulation and regulate endocrine functions, while tourmaline releases negative ions, balances the body's bioelectricity, and brings positive energy. Wearing them long-term can bring beauty and health to the wearer.

Perfect for: those seeking increased energy, creativity, emotional healing, and spiritual growth through the revitalizing and balancing properties of Garnet.
